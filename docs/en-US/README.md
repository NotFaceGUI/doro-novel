     To facilitate obtaining the latest character resources, we provide cross-platform automatic update scripts:
     
     #### Windows Users
     ```powershell
     # Execute in the application installation directory
     .\update_l2d.ps1
     ```
     
     #### Mac Users
     ```bash
     # Execute in the application installation directory
     ./update_l2d_mac.sh
     ```
     
     #### Linux Users

     # Execute in the application installation directory
     ./update_l2d_linux.sh
     ```
     
     #### Script Functionality
     
     These scripts will automatically perform the following operations:
     
     1. **Check Git Environment**
        - Windows: Automatically download and extract MinGit portable version (approximately 45MB)
        - Mac/Linux: Check system Git installation and provide installation guidance
     
     2. **Clone/Update Resource Repository**

     #### üôè Acknowledgments
     
     Special thanks to the [Nikke-db](https://github.com/Nikke-db) team for maintaining the open-source resource repository [Nikke-db.github.io](https://github.com/Nikke-db/Nikke-db.github.io), providing complete character resource data for the community. This repository contains high-quality Spine animation resources for all characters in the game, enabling this project to provide rich character display functionality for users.
     
     Without their selfless contribution and continuous maintenance, the character system of this project would not be able to achieve such complete functionality.
